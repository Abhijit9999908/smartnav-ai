📍 SmartNav-AIReal-Time GPS Navigation & Routing in the BrowserSmartNav-AI is a lightweight, responsive web application that brings native-app GPS capabilities to the browser. By leveraging the Browser Geolocation API and Leaflet.js, it provides live movement tracking, route visualization, and real-time ETA calculations without the need for heavy installations.🚀 Key FeaturesLive Geospatial Tracking: Real-time location updates using the high-accuracy Browser Geolocation API.Dynamic Route Mapping: Interactive map visualization with auto-updating paths.Navigation Dashboard: Instant feedback on current coordinates, estimated distance, and ETA.Cross-Platform Design: Fully responsive UI optimized for both mobile "on-the-go" use and desktop browsing.Privacy-Centric: Request-based location access ensuring user data control.🛠️ Tech StackLayerTechnologyFrontendJavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3BackendPython (Flask)Mapping EngineLeaflet.jsGeolocationWeb Browser Geolocation APIDeploymentRender🧠 System ArchitectureSmartNav-AI operates on a client-side heavy architecture to ensure low latency for location updates:Permission Layer: The browser triggers a secure navigator.geolocation prompt.Data Acquisition: Latitude and longitude are captured and passed to the Leaflet map instance.Backend Integration: Flask handles potential route calculations and serves the application logic.UI Rendering: CSS3 transitions provide smooth "marker sliding" as the user moves in the real world.⚡ Quick StartPrerequisitesPython 3.xA modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) with Location Services enabled.InstallationClone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/Abhijit9999908/smartnav-ai.git

Access the AppNavigate to http://localhost:5000 and grant location permissions when prompted.📈 Roadmap & Future Enhancements[ ] Voice-Guided Navigation: Integration with Web Speech API for hands-free directions.[ ] AI Route Optimization: Using machine learning to suggest routes based on historical traffic data.[ ] Offline Mode: Service Worker integration for map caching in low-signal areas.[ ] Multi-Stop Routing: Ability to add waypoints between start and destination.🎯 Why This MattersThis project serves as a practical implementation of asynchronous JavaScript and RESTful API design. It demonstrates how to handle real-world sensor data (GPS) and translate it into a meaningful user interface—a core skill for modern full-stack developers.Developed by [Abhijit] Contributions and feedback are welcome!
